ernaie
======

`ernaie`, literally `er`(the) `naie`(language), is the language of the Telperi.
The following is the only official dictionary in english language for `ernaie`.

General
-------

This dictionary depicts `ernaie` using the common alphabet for lack of an alternative.
`ernaie` is a spoken, not a written language, thus the Telperi see no need
in providing writable characters. The only written sources of `ernaie` have
been made by outsiders, who wrote down what the Telperi told them. In order
to make the Telperi sayings accessible to as many readers as possible,
the authors of those texts used the character of the common alphabet.

Time
++++

The Telperi differenciate only between three times:
the past, the present and the future.
To describe events that occured in the past,
the ending `~an` is appended to every verb in the setence.
To describe events that occure in the present,
the ending of the verbs stays unchanged.
"Gowa" translates to "now".
To describe events that will occure in the future,
the ending `~in` is appended to evey verb in the setence.
"Se eren" which translates to "I am" thus becomes
"Se erenan", "I was" and "Se erenin", "I will be".
"Gowa`an" means "Yesterday" or "In the past" and
"Gowain" means "Tomorrow" or "In the future".

Article
+++++++

In `ernaie` the only article is `er`. It is the equivalent of
the word `the` in common.

Singular/Plural
+++++++++++++++

To distinguish between one or many the Telperi append single "characters"
to their nouns, depending on the type of its last character.
Nouns ending in a vowel will have an `~r` appended, as in "Se nai naie",
which translates to "I speak (one) language" and becomes "Se nai naier",
"I speak (many) languages".
Nouns ending in a consonant will have an `~i` appended, as in "Er ion",
which translates to "This tree" and becomes "Er ioni",
"These trees".

Negation
++++++++

To negate a setence or a word the word `do` is added either at the begining
or at the end of the setence/word. Thus "I don't speak any language" becomes
"Do se nai naie". However "Se nai naie do" and "Se nai do naie" are also valid
forms.

Numbers
+++++++

The Telperi use the decimal system.
0   do
1   ei
2   bei
3   sei
4   dei
5   nei
6   auei
7   ouei
8   euei
9   uiei

1x      ~n
1xx     ~a
1xxx    ~r
1xxxx   ~e

Thus "12" would be "ein bei" and "3024" "seir bein dei".


The name Telperion can be interpreted as
"Te elpe er ion" which would literally translate to "You, the big tree".
The term Telperi designates those who serve Telperion and live by his way.
It formed from the expression "Te eren elpe er ion, na erenin ista er ioni",
which roughly translates to "You are the big tree, we will be the small trees".
